# coredump_setup - enable core dumps globally for any process
#                  that has the core-file-size limit set correctly
#
# NOTE: You must call also coredump_enable for a specific process
#       if its core-file-size limit is not set already.
# NOTE: Core dumps are written to ramdisk; they will not survive a reboot!
